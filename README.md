# mem1_phonegap
Trying phonegap with Wasm with the game mem1 written in Rust Webassembly with Virtual Dom.  
On Win10 the development version is server from PhoneGap Desktop.  
Running the app in Chrome browser works fine.  
But running it on my android 6.0.1 (Galaxy Note 4) with PhoneGap Developer app it does NOT work. 
The index.html content is rendered well until it comes to the javascript for Wasm.
I don't know why.
Cannot try it this way for iPhone, because Apple does not allw the PhoneGap Developer app.

The source code of the original app is here:  
[https://github.com/LucianoBestia/mem1](https://github.com/LucianoBestia/mem1)  

# How to install phonegap on Win10
1. Win10 : On https://phonegap.com/getstarted/ download and start the installer for PhoneGap Desktop.  
2. Android : install PhoneGap Developer app  

# Cloning the code
3. Clone this repository.  
```
git clone https://github.com/LucianoBestia/mem1_phonegap
```
It is based on the Hello sample generated by PhoneGap Desktop.  
Inside the www folder I added the folders: www/pkg and www/content, then the files www/index.html and www/css/mem1.css.  

# Running the code
4. Win10: Start PhoneGap Desktop, click the Plus button and open existing PhoneGap project.
5. Win10: Clik the Play button to start the development server.
6. Win10: Click the URL of the running server on the bottom it will open the browser.
The application works as intended.
